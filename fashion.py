# Test the Fashion class with tax and shipping
item1 = Fashion("Dress", "Zara", 49.99)
item1.describe()
item1.apply_discount(20)
item1.apply_tax(5)  # 5% tax
item1.apply_shipping(10)  # Shipping cost $10

item2 = Fashion("Shoes", "Nike", 89.99)
item2.describe()
item2.apply_discount(15)
item2.apply_tax(8)  # 8% tax
item2.apply_shipping(15)  # Shipping cost $15


# Polymorphism Challenge (Added Below)
class Vehicle:
    def move(self):
        pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Driving üöó")

class Plane(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Flying ‚úàÔ∏è")

# Test polymorphism
car = Car()
plane = Plane()

car.move()   # Expected output: "Driving üöó"
plane.move() # Expected output: "Flying ‚úàÔ∏è"
